# EmotionDetection
Psychiatric disorders are present in nearly all suicide victims. Depression is normally the root of suicidal thoughts. While there are anti-depressant dugs and psychiatric treatments available for these patients, there is no form of device available that can detect depression episode in these patients. Such episodes can be detected and characterized by monitoring vocal tone and form of conversation of these patients. Since such episodes can occur at any time, an immediate psychiatric treatment may not be available. A simpler form of treatment could be to have an intervention through a phone call, an SMS with a cheerful joke or a link to small video clip. While not targeting any system for such psychiatric disorder, lets implement a simple mood swing detector with a library of jokes, which can cheer up people, when such swing occurs. Types of mood that we are interested in are – • Normal • Cheerful • Angry • Depressed
